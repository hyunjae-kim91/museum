The 2022 Major League Baseball season will best be remembered for Aaron Judge chasing the American League home run record set by Roger Maris in 1961. Like Maris, the eyes of the baseball world were on Judge after he tied Babe Ruth with home run No. 60 on Sept 20. Once Judge reached 60, MLB started marking each baseball hit by Judge to potentially record history.
Such is the case with this offered Official Major League Robert D. Manfred Jr. stamped baseball that was thrown to Judge for two pitches by Mitchell White out of the strike zone in the top of the fourth inning of the Sept. 28, 2022, game between the Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays at the Rogers Centre in Toronto. This was only three innings away from Judge tying Maris, as he would hit his 61st home run in the top of the 7th inning.
This offered baseball has "T" and "4" stamped on the panel with the MLB logo.
There is a large dirt stain on the side panel, presumably when the second pitch thrown to Judge in the top of the 4th inning hit the dirt and was then taken out of play. This ball comes with an MLB Authenticated hologram (JD265973), authenticating that this ball was used during the Sept. 28, 2022, game during the top of the 4th inning during Aaron Judge's at-bat.
